1. What roles does HTML page have in web apps?
   - HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is crucial for web applications in several ways. It structures web pages, provides semantic meaning to content, presents information to users, enables interactivity, and ensures cross-platform compatibility. In essence, HTML forms the backbone of modern web development, shaping how content is organized, presented, and interacted with across different devices and platforms.
2. Why do we need to use templating systems (e.g., Jinja2)?
   - Templating systems like Jinja2 simplify web development by enabling code reuse, dynamic content generation, and separation of concerns. They inject variables and logic into HTML templates, ensuring consistency across pages while allowing customization. Additionally, these systems enhance security by sanitizing user input and optimize performance by caching templates, resulting in faster rendering times and improved scalability. In summary, templating systems are essential for building efficient and maintainable web applications.
